# Test

This is a demo repo by starting anew from local machine

## Steps

1. git init
2. git add
3. git commit
4. git push

## Adding a new origin remotely

1. git remote add <remote name> <remote URL>

where: 
remote name such as origin
remote URL -> git@github.com:<username>/<repo_name.git>

2. Step 1 seems to not work. Thus, tried again using Step 3.

3. remote URL -> https://github.com/<username>/<repo_name>.git
